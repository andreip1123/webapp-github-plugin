WebApp GitHub connector
=======================

This plugin enables oXygen XML WebApp to open and commit files on GitHub. 

Open
----
In order to open a github file, you should provide the URL that points to that file on github, for
example `https://github.com/ctalau-oxygen/flowers/blob/master/flowers.ditamap`.


Commit
------
When you open a GitHub file, a *Commit to GitHub* button appears on the toolbar. When you press that
button, you will be asked to:
 - authenticate 
 - provide the commit message
 - (optional) the name of a new branch on which this commit goes.
